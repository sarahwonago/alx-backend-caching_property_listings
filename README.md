# Property Listing Application with Multi-Level Caching

## Overview

This project implements a Django-based property listing application with **Redis caching** at multiple levels. The system demonstrates various caching strategies including:

- **View-level caching**
- **Low-level queryset caching**
- **Proper cache invalidation techniques**

The application uses **Docker** to containerize **PostgreSQL** for data persistence and **Redis** for caching, providing a realistic development environment that mirrors production setups.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

- Implement multi-level caching strategies in Django applications
- Configure and integrate Redis as a cache backend
- Set up containerized services (PostgreSQL and Redis) using Docker
- Understand cache invalidation techniques using Django signals
- Analyze cache performance metrics
- Develop efficient database query patterns with caching
- Structure Django projects for maintainability and scalability

---

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-level Caching:** Implementing both view-level and low-level caching
- **Cache Invalidation:** Using Django signals to maintain cache consistency
- **Containerization:** Managing dependencies with Docker containers
- **Cache Metrics:** Monitoring and analyzing Redis cache performance
- **Database Optimization:** Reducing database load through intelligent caching

---

## Tools and Libraries

- **Django:** Web framework for building the property listing application
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for persistent storage
- **Redis:** In-memory data store used for caching
- **Docker:** Containerization platform for service management
- **django-redis:** Django cache backend for Redis integration
- **psycopg2:** PostgreSQL adapter for Python
- **Pythonâ€™s logging module:** For tracking cache metrics and performance

## Real-World Use Case

This project models a real estate listing platform where:

1. Property listings are **frequently accessed but rarely modified**
2. **Database load** needs to be minimized during peak traffic
3. **Data consistency** must be maintained despite caching
4. **Performance metrics** are monitored to optimize cache effectiveness

Such caching implementations are crucial for:

- High-traffic listing platforms (real estate, e-commerce)
- Applications with expensive database queries
- Systems requiring **sub-second response times**
- Platforms needing to **scale efficiently under load**

The techniques demonstrated provide a blueprint for building **performant web applications** while maintaining **data consistency** and reducing **infrastructure costs**.
